## Outlook

```yml
mail:
  smtpHostAddress: smtp-mail.outlook.com # required
  smtpHostPort: 485 # required
  senderAddress: sender@hotmail.com # required
  senderPassword: senderPassowrd # required
  receiverAddresses:
    - receiver@mail.com
```

Unlike [Gmail](gmail.md), using your account's password works right away, no further configuration is needed.
